# Notes on soft type translation

- Making soft type automation work in our set-theoretic setting means that concepts are inevitably duplicated across both languages (elaborate).

- For fundamental concepts—in particular \in, \subset, and functions—it is desirable to be able to freely switch between either language. Declaring soft type translations makes certain set-theoretic concepts known to type inference (elaborate).
