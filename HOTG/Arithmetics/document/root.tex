\begin{abstract}
In this work, we present the formalization of generalized set addition and multiplication within
 the Isabelle-Set framework, drawing upon foundational insights from Kirby's article. We extend 
this foundation by incorporating transfinite recursion and functions restriction for the inductive
 definition of set arithmetic operations, thereby clarifying their fundamental properties. 
Specifically, we confirm the satisfaction of the associative law for both set addition and
 multiplication. Additionally, we demonstrate the compatibility between set and ordinal addition. 
The integration of concepts such as cardinals, ordinals, member transitive closure, and comparison
 operators from ZFC_in_HOL_AFP enhances our framework, making the comparison of sets feasible and 
laying the groundwork for theorem proving.
