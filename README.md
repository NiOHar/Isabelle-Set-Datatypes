# Isabelle/Set [![Build Status](https://github.com/kappelmann/Isabelle-Set/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kappelmann/Isabelle-Set/actions)

Isabelle/Set is a mathematical environment that aims to combine the flexibility of set theory and expressiveness of type theory.
As a mathematical foundation, it is based on higher-order Tarski-Grothendieck set theory.
On top of this, it builds an optional layer of soft types in the object logic.

A soft type can simply be thought as a predicate verifying certain properties about the mathematical entity in question.
These predicates can be arbitrarily complex, allowing simple assertions such as an entity being a member of a certain set (e.g. "n : Nat")
all the way to dependently typed assertions such as "zero\_vector : (n : Nat) -> Vector n".

Soft types are not unique: an entity can belong to many different soft types.
As an example, both "1 : Nat" and "1 : Int" are valid soft type assertions.
This is in contrast to conventional type-theoretical environments where each term belongs to a unique, unalterable type.
Those systems have to insert explicit casts to transform terms from one type to another.

## How to Build / Run

This code currently depends on [the Isabelle repository](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle).
The file `ISABELLE_VERSION` specifies the exact revision, which will also be used
in the automated builds.

* Clone and prepare the Isabelle development version.
  Instructions can be found in the
  [README_REPOSITORY](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/tip/README_REPOSITORY).

* Clone and navigate into this repository and setup the dependencies (git submodules):
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:kappelmann/Isabelle-Set.git
  cd Isabelle_Set
  git submodule sync
  git submodule update --init
  ```
  If you are using git via https, replace the first command with
  `git clone https://github.com/kappelmann/Isabelle-Set.git`

* Build the supporting Isabelle heap images:
  ```bash
  /path/to/isabelle/bin/isabelle build -vbRD .
  ```

* Build this development:
  ```
  /path/to/isabelle/bin/isabelle build -vD .
  ```

## Style Guide

As a continuous effort, we make use of and iterate on the recently developed
[Isabelle Community Conventions](https://isabelle.systems/conventions/)
