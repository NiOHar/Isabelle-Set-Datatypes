# Isabelle/Set [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/bb/cezaryka/tyset.svg?style=svg&circle-token=2fc0576de43f1f1852e8500afc862e43da2ee1e5)](https://circleci.com/bb/cezaryka/tyset)

Isabelle/Set is a mathematical environment that aims to combine the flexibility of set theory and expressiveness of type theory.
As a mathematical foundation, it is based on higher-order Tarski-Grothendieck set theory.
On top of this, it builds an optional layer of soft types in the object logic.

A soft type can simply be thought as a predicate verifying certain properties about the mathematical entity in question.
These predicates can be arbitrarily complex, allowing simple assertions such as an entity being a member of a certain set (e.g. "n : Nat")
all the way to dependently typed assertions such as "zero\_vector : (n : Nat) -> Vector n".

Soft types are not unique: an entity can belong to many different soft types.
As an example, both "1 : Nat" and "1 : Int" are valid soft type assertions.
This is in contrast to conventional type-theoretical environments where each term belongs to a unique, unalterable type.
Those systems have to insert explicit casts to transform terms from one type to another.

## How to build / run

This code currently depends on [the Isabelle repository](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle),
which contains ongoing changes after the Isabelle2020 release.
The file ISABELLE_VERSION specifies the exact revision, which
will also be used in the automated builds.

* Clone and prepare the Isabelle development version.
Instructions can be found in the [README_REPOSITORY](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/tip/README_REPOSITORY).

* Clone and navigate into this repository and setup the dependencies (git submodules).

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:cezaryka/tyset.git isabelle_set
cd isabelle_set
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init
```
If you are using git via https, replace the first command with `git clone https://bitbucket.org/cezaryka/tyset.git` 

* Build the supporting Isabelle heap images
```
/path/to/isabelle/bin/isabelle build -vbRD .
```
* Build this development
```
/path/to/isabelle/bin/isabelle build -vD .
```

## Style Guide

As a continuous effort, we make use of and iterate on the recently developed [Isabelle Community Conventions](https://isabelle.systems/conventions/)
